Git: Git is a distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. 

GitHub: GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service, which offers all of the distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. 


There are two ways of installing Git.

 Create a remote central repository on GitHub.

create a local repository using git (I am using Git software on Windows 10)

Open your file explorer, navigate to the working directory, right-click and select “Git Bash Here”. This opens the Git terminal. To create a new local repository use the command git init and it creates a folder .git.
